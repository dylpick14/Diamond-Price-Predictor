# Diamond-Price-Predictor

This project using python and Machine Learning to train and predict what the cost of a diamond based upon an exist database.
A bunch of features from the dataset are used to predict the diamond using Ridge Regression and Linear Support Vector Regression models.
It will show the statistics from those models including the average error and the mean square error to show how close predictions were to the diamonds actual price
